## About the Repository

Hello, I'm Jeomin Gimmi, a student/educator/developer passionate about learning and applying software development principles. This repository is a curated collection of my work through the course, showcasing my progress and the lessons learned along the way.

## Lessons Learned

- Readability Matters: Writing code that is easy to read and understand is just as important as making it work.
- Refactoring is Your Friend: Regularly revisiting and refining code can lead to more efficient and maintainable outcomes.
- Consistency is Key: Following a consistent naming convention and coding style helps in maintaining a standard across the codebase.
